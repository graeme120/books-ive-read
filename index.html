      <h1>Books I've Read, 2020 Onwards</h1>
      <p>
        In early 2020 I had an ephiphany regarding the beauty of knowledge, and
        what a privilege it is to be able to educate oneself. Suddenly, school,
        books, classes, all forms of education acquired a weight that I hadn't
        previously considered. We have so much power to influence and elevate
        our own thinking, and have never had more access to resources to do so.
        Although this access to information comes with many caveats, the fact of
        its existence I still consider to be a marvellous feat by humanity.<br /><br />
        Here are all the books i've read since that epiphany, complete with
        PDFs, so that my knowledge can become yours as well.
